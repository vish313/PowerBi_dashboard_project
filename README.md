This is Power BI end to end project

An interactive Power BI dashboard. It beautifully illustrates year-wise insights such as sales, quantity, sales by segment, and even the top 5 most profitable products from the global superstore. I've had the pleasure of delving into this dashboard, which derives its data from the comprehensive dataset named global_superstore. 

Over the span of four years, it has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the global superstore's performance and trends, offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
